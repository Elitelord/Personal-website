# My Wolfram Summer Research Adventure: Building Pac-Man with OpenStreetMap

This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the Wolfram Summer Research Program. It was an intense but rewarding 2.5 weeks where I dove deep into the world of Wolfram Language and explored its capabilities. My project focused on creating a playable Pac-Man game using OpenStreetMap data, and it was an exciting journey from start to finish.

## The Challenge: Merging Maps and Games

The idea was to take real-world geographic data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and transform it into a Pac-Man maze. I wanted to see if I could use OSM to access the street layout of a city and then build a movement system around that data. It was a challenging concept, but the Wolfram Language proved to be the perfect tool for the job.

## Building the Game: From Streets to Mazes

The first step was to get familiar with OSM and how to extract the data I needed. Once I had the street layout, I used the Wolfram Language's powerful graphics and computational geometry functions to convert it into a playable maze. It was amazing to see the streets of a real city transform into the familiar Pac-Man grid.
Next, I had to implement Pac-Man's movement and the ghost's AI. I used a similar structure to the original Pac-Man game, but I had to adapt it to work with the OSM data. It was a fun challenge to figure out how to make the ghosts move intelligently within the constraints of the real-world map.
Finally, I added the finishing touches, including power pellets, a scoring system, and other game features. It was incredibly satisfying to see all the pieces come together and create a fully functional Pac-Man game.

## Presentation Day: Sharing My Creation
At the end of the program, I had the chance to present my project to my classmates. It was a bit nerve-wracking, but it was also a great opportunity to showcase what I had accomplished. I was proud of the game I had created, and it was rewarding to see others enjoy playing it.

## Key Takeaways
This experience taught me so much about the power of the Wolfram Language and its potential for creative projects. I also gained valuable skills in problem-solving, data manipulation, and game development.
